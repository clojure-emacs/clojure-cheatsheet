* Clojure Cheatsheet for Emacs
The incredibly handy [[http://clojure.org/cheatsheet][Clojure Cheatsheet]], updated for Clojure 1.7.0 and
packaged into an easy, fast, searchable, offline form:

** Status
Ready to use. Based on Clojure 1.7.0.

** Installation

If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET clojure-cheatsheet
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively just grab the single =clojure-cheatsheet.el= file and
install that in your preferred way.

*** Keybindings

The cheatsheet doesn't ship with keybindings - people tend to have
strong opinions on them. As a reminder, here's how to define custom
=clojure-mode= keybindings in your own =.emacs= config:

**** Regular Emacs
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (eval-after-load 'clojure-mode
    '(progn
       (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-h") #'clojure-cheatsheet)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Evil Users
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (evil-define-key 'normal
    clojure-mode-map "H" 'clojure-cheatsheet)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Basic Usage

Call =M-x clojure-cheatsheet= and the cheatsheet will appear. Type
in some terms (space separated) to narrow down the list. For example,
try typing in =sort map= to see some functions that deal with sorting maps.

*** Keys

| =C-n=   | Next item.                                                                         |
| =C-p=   | Previous item.                                                                     |
| =C-o=   | Next section.                                                                      |
| =RET=   | Jump to the Clojure docs for the current selection.                                |
| =C-z=   | Jump to the Clojure docs for the current selection /without closing the cheatsheet/. |
| =C-e=   | Jump to the Clojure src for the current selection.                                 |
| =C-h m= | Full list of keyboard shortcuts.                                                   |

** Advanced Usage

This package stands on top of Helm. The variable
=helm-source-clojure-cheatsheet= is available if you want to mix it in
as a Helm source.

** Building

The constant =clojure-cheatsheet-hierarchy= defines the contents of
the cheatsheet. See the docstring of that constant for a full
description of the format.

There is a test suite in =clojure-cheatsheet-tests.el=
that checks that every symbol defined in the cheatsheet is valid, and
that every symbol defined by Clojure is in the sheet (with a few
explicit exceptions).

To run the test suite:

- Clone the project.
- Open =clojure-cheatsheet-tests.el= and eval the whole file.
- Call =M-x cider-jack-in= to start a Clojure REPL.
- Call =M-x ert <RET>= to run the test suite.
- Optional: Marvel at Emacs' support for test suites.
